                <h1>Low Back Pain</h1><br>
                <p>
                    Low back pain (LBP), is a very common medical condition characterized by discomfort or pain in the lower part of the spine, specifically in the area between the rib cage and the pelvis. It is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorders globally and can affect people of all ages. Low back pain can range from mild and occasional discomfort to severe and debilitating pain, which may significantly impact a person's quality of life and daily activities.

                        <h3>Muscle Strain</h3>
                        <p>One of the most frequent causes of low back pain is muscle strain or overuse. Activities that involve lifting heavy objects, sudden movements, or poor posture can lead to strained muscles or ligaments in the lower back.</p>

                        <h3>Herniated Or Bulging Discs</h3>
                        <p>The spine is made up of intervertebral discs that act as cushions between the vertebrae. Over time, these discs can degenerate or herniate, causing pressure on the nearby nerves and resulting in pain.</p>

                    <div class="Services-Middle-Paragraph">
                        <h3>Spinal Stenosis</h3>
                        <p>Spinal stenosis is a condition where the spinal canal narrows, putting pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. This can lead to low back pain, as well as leg pain (sciatica).</p>

                        <h3>Injuries</h3>
                        <p>Traumatic incidents like car accidents, falls, or sports injuries can cause damage to the lower back, resulting in pain and discomfort.</p>

                        <h3>Lifestyle Factors/ Postural LBP</h3>
                        <p>Sedentary lifestyles, obesity, and poor physical fitness can contribute to low back pain. Lack of exercise weakens the muscles that support the spine and can lead to pain.</p>

                        <p>Stress, anxiety, and depression can exacerbate or contribute to the perception of low back pain. These psychological factors can increase muscle tension and make the pain feel more severe.</p>
