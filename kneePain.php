                <p>
                    Knee joint is the biggest joint in our body and works as a connection between the hip and the foot. It helps in transmitting the load of the body from the hip and core to our feet and thus allows us to stand , move and balance. It comprises various ligaments which provide stability to the joint and meniscus which provides cushioning to the joint. Knee pain is a common medical complaint that can affect people of all age groups. The prevalence can vary based on factors like age , lifestyle , gender and underlying health conditions.
