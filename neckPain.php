                <p>
                Neck pain refers to discomfort or pain experienced in the region of the neck, 
                which is located between the base of the skull and the upper part of the shoulders. 
                It can range from mild and occasional discomfort to severe and persistent pain. 
                Neck pain can be caused by various factors, including muscle strain, poor posture, injury, or underlying medical conditions.
                Here are some common causes of neck pain:

                    <p>Treatment for neck pain depends on its underlying cause and severity. It may include self-care measures 
                        (rest, ice or heat therapy), physiotherapy, pain medications, exercises, lifestyle modifications, 
                        and in some cases, surgical interventions. If you're experiencing persistent or severe neck pain, 
                        contact us and get yourself assessed for your personalized treatment plan.
